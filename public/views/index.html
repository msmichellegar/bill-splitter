        <h1>Split the Bill</h1>
        <!-- <p>If you're on a date with a person of the opposite sex, you might be struggling with the age-old dating dilemma: who pays? In 2016, women worldwide earn 70c to a man's dollar. Female-centric professions are consistently placed amongst the lowest-earning, and women's items like tampons are taxed as "luxuries". So ladies, next time you're on a date with a man, let him pay 65% of the bill. He can afford it.</p> -->
