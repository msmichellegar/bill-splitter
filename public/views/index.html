        <h1>Split the Bill</h1>
        <p class="feminist-propaganda">If you're on a date with a person of the opposite sex, you might be struggling with the age-old dating dilemma: who pays? Well, let's play it fair. In 2016, women worldwide earn 70c to a man's dollar, female-centric professions are consistently placed amongst the lowest-earning, and women's items like tampons are taxed as "luxuries".</p>
        <p class="feminist-propaganda">So ladies, next time you're on a date with a man, let him pay 65% of the bill. He can afford it.</p>
